# The default is just too small.

# We will skip it for tests, the Grape API and Rake tasks.

  Exclude:
    - spec/**/*

# NOTE: this could be further trimmed down but the following refactorings are
# needed:
#   1. The Grape API classes should be further modularized (probably in helper
#      modules).
#   2. The models regarding the registry have to be modularized.
#   3. LDAP has to be refactored.

# Style
#

# It's not needed to add documentation for obvious modules or classes. The main
# idea is that documentation will be asked during the review process if needed.
Style/Documentation:
  Enabled: false

# NOTE: this is giving false positives because it assumes some Rails 5 methods
# are available.
Style/InverseMethods:
  Enabled: false

# This forces us to create a new object for no real reason.
Style/MultipleComparison:
  Enabled: false

# This is a common SUSE configuration value: the performance difference between
# single and double quotes is no longer there, and so it's better to be
# consistent and force only double quotes.
Style/StringLiterals:
  EnforcedStyle: double_quotes

# Same as Style/StringLiterals.
Style/StringLiteralsInInterpolation:
  EnforcedStyle: double_quotes

# There are some false positives (e.g. "module ::Module", in which we want to
# make sure there are no clashes or misunderstandings). Therefore, we just
# disable this cop.
Style/ClassAndModuleChildren:
  Enabled: false

# This was added in rubocop 0.60, but as seen on a couple of issues upstream, it
# is not too clear why this cop is needed (DateTime might make sense on some
# ruby versions). So, it's better to disable this for now.

# Naming
